WOW-stream
----------

WOW-stream is just a toy project in order to improve my haskell knowledge. The application is a server that listens for websocket connections from clients. After successfull connection clients can listen to a twitter streams which is provided by the server. Clients can apply a filter to the stream and talk to other connected clients or request a list of all connected clients.

The application is not really useful by itself. I was just aiming to use different technologies like Streaming Data (Twitter Stream - Http Long Polling), Websocket connection and integration of Polysemy for application architecture.
